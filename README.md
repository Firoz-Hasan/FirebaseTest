# FirebaseTest
# Objective One : 
This is testing project to show how to save and retrieve data to firebase. 
If we have only 1 data like only username or just firstname or just one field we can just save it as string or whatever but if we have
2 or more fields for example (username & password) or GPS Coordinates (longitude and latitude).
What we can do in that case we can save those fields (more than 1 field) in 2 different ways.
# 1st way :
In a model class/pojo class we can declare those fields, then when sending or receiving DATA to firebase instance / objcect of that model class/ pojo class.
# 2nd way :
Take hashmap and save data in hashmap and send and receive data as hashmap.
# Objective Two :
Listview / custom listview and handler post delayed has been implemented.
